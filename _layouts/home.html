        <p>
            I’m a <strong>third-year Ph.D. student</strong> in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at <strong>UMass Amherst</strong>, working at the intersection of 
            <strong>Decision-Making under Uncertainty</strong> and <strong>Computational Economics</strong>. 
            I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://hedyehbeyhaghi.github.io">Hedyeh Beyhaghi</a> and co-advised by Prof.
            <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/">Mohammad Hajiesmaili</a>. I collaborate closely with 
            the <a href="https://solar.cs.umass.edu">Solar Lab</a> and was previously part of the FED Lab, 
            lead by Prof. <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/index.html">Yair Zick</a>. 
            Additionally, I had the privilege of working under the tutelage of Prof. 
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=70Rmp1oAAAAJ&hl=en">Mohammad Ghodsi</a> during my academic journey.
        </p>

        <p>My research revolves around applying <strong>online learning</strong> to <strong>Econ\CS</strong> problems, with a focus on <strong>algorithmic game theory</strong>, <strong>matching markets</strong>,
          and <strong>resource allocation</strong>. I’m particularly excited about <strong>statistical learning theory</strong> and <strong>multi-armed bandits</strong>, where I aim to design efficient, practical algorithms 
          that smartly balance <strong>exploration</strong> and <strong>exploitation</strong> in uncertain, dynamic environments.</p>
